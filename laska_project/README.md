# 🎓 Laska Exam System

Hello! Welcome to my project, Laska Exam System. This is a web application I build to help student take their exam on the internet easily. I use Python Flask and Tailwind CSS for making this.

## ✨ Features in this project
* User Dashboard: A page for student to see the courses they will take.
* Smart Quiz: * If you flag a question, it will not count in final score.
    * Student can not go back to previous question (unless it is flagged).
* Auto Timer: There is a clock counting down. When the time is finish, the exam will submit by itself automatically.
* No Internet Needed for Design: I setup Tailwind CSS locally (version 3). So the design will load very fast and work even if you don't have internet connection.

## 🛠️ Technology I Use
* Backend: Python (Flask)
* Frontend: HTML5, Tailwind CSS v3
